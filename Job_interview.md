# How to make a job interview:

1) You don't want to sell what you are not, but you do want to sell the best version of yourself.

2) Do your homework. Read about the lab, read some papers of the PI, see if she/he is on twitter, read about the university. If your funding is linked to a project, ask to read the project in advance. If you are shy, prepare a question that genuinely interests you on a lab’s paper. It’s a good icebreaker and show you are interested. Questions do not need to be extra clever, but just to show curiosity. e.g. I loved that paper, do you plan to follow up on this type of experiments/systems/question/models?

3) Listen first. Probably the interviewer will guide you thought the interview. It’s ok to say you don’t know something or to correct yourself if you notice you started saying something you don’t really think. This happens.

4) It’s a bidirectional process. Show you are also evaluating the place were you may potentially work. Ask about lab culture and practices (e.g. lab meetings, seminars, one-on-one meeting frequency, interactions with other lab members). Ask about things that matter to you. e.g. Open science practices, software used for stats, use of git, or any method you know well. Share your habits and be open to help other future lab-mates to get started on this things. If the job is linked to a project ask how flexible is your research project, if there money for going on conferences/stays abroad?  

5) Ask about the city and use the opportunity to introduce your hobbies, sports, music, etc… showing we are humans is fine and you may share hobbies with the interviewer, which is always good.
