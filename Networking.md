# At a conference

Some tips on making the best of attending a conference / workshop / school. 

### People, Not Papers

All the papers are available online, talks might be recorded and you can take photos of slides.

👉 Prioritize meeting new people over attending every single talk.

### Be approachable

It's comfortable to walk together with people you already know and talk in your own language. But, you will be a lot less approachable to people who want to connect with you!

👉 Reserve some solo time.

👉 During networking sessions, be mindful of how you stand in a group. Leave some space for other people to join the conversation. 


### Start a conversation
Use context to start an easy conversation 

Where? Lunch table, coffee line, seatmate, gift bag line, taxi line, elevator, restroom line, charging station

👉 Look for opportunities everywhere!

👉 Don't seat at an empty table or an empty row.

👉 Don't just try meeting senior "pope". You can find a new enthusiastic collaborator among your peers

👉 Prepare your presentation (elevator speech) in advance.

Visual cues telling people NOT to talk with you:

❌ Check cellphone

❌ Work on your laptop

❌ Wear an headphone

👉 Put down your screens and meet people!

👉 Nervous? Grab a cup. You will have your hands occupied, you can fill silences by drinking, you can escape by saying you are going to refill...

### How to finish a conversation

1) Compliment: "It was great talking with you."

(optional) Excuse: " I am going to grab another croissant!

2) Follow-up item: "I will follow up with you on twitter/email." / "See you around in the social dinner tonight."

3) After the conference,  follow up with the people you meet and thank them by email, a following on your favourite social media... This simple step goes a long way!
