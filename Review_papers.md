How to make a review:  

1) it's ok to ask the editor (before accepting) to co-revise it with your advisor. This is a good way to start and editors are likely to agree on the deal.  

2) Your job is to summarize (i) the main contribution of the paper (ii) any major concern you have with methods/interpretation of results, etc... (iii) minor concerns and in line minor comments.  

3) Your job is not to accept or reject the paper. Your job is to suggest how to improve the paper.  

4) If you are not familiar with any method and can not evaluate it's soundness, its ok. Just explain this to the editor. E.g. I can't comment on method X as I am not qualified to assess it's soundness. This is ok.    

5) be very polite and think about it as a conversation with the authors.  

6) Trust your knowledge
