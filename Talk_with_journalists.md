# How to talk with journalists:

Most journalists are professionals who will guide you through the process, but some have little time, so it's good to be prepared. 

1) Ask in advance for the questions (or approximate topics to cover) so you can prepare. Ensure your name and affiliation is used as you want. This seems obvious but affiliations and positions are far from trivial to decode for non academics.

2) Have an agenda. Write down the key messages you want to explain (e.g. if it's about a paper, what do you want to highlight?). If the journalist don't ask you this questions, you can reframe any question to answer what you want to say. Politicians do this all the time. This is important because they may not know that something was important to ask. e.g. "You are asking about honeybees, but there are thousands of wild bees that are far more interesting ... ". Bring the discussion home.

3) It's ok to say you don't know something, or you don't have an informed opinion on something. Refer to the appropriate experts if needed. Bonus points if you refer to female experts, which are credited less often.

4) Repeat your key ideas. In science we tend to be synthetic, but complex ideas are worth being explained from different angles. It's also important to keep it simple. When talking to a general audience, maybe it's more important to highlight the context of your paper (e.g. "bees are important and need conservation measures") than the specific details (e.g. "there is an interactive effect between two complex experimental treatments").

5) Use stories and metaphors. Get personal, if something funny or unexpected happened during fieldwork, this stories will engage with readers. Metaphors or comparisons with daily life experiences are great to explain complex ideas. 

6) Ask to see the piece before this one is published. Most journalists appreciate this and you can correct any misinterpretation. When done, do not edit the piece in your style or add extra details, but ensure all the facts are correct.
